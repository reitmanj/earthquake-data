Earthquakes: Programming and Interfaces Module

In this module, we will introduce a data set containing details about earthquakes around the world. You will learn how to pull this data into a program, search through the data, and filter the data based on desired criteria. By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. write programs that include multiple classes and ArrayLists of class types

2. find the maximum value in an ArrayList

3. use a Filter interface to search through data

4. implement interfaces with method signatures, and combine several filters together.
